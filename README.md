- Started on Jan.24, 2020

In this project, we will build a distributed power grid system using multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to achieve voltage/frequency control.

## Building the system on Simulink

#### Single inverter-based Photovoltaic system.

First, we build a system [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FhgHS1JsE) based on a DC voltage source.
