# PVRL

#### Robotics and Intelligent Vehicle Automation Lab (RIVAL)
- Built by Dong Chen
- Started on Jan.24, 2020

In this project, we will build a distributed power grid system using multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to achieve voltage/frequency control.

## Building the system on Simulink

#### Single inverter-based Photovoltaic system.

- [Model with no controller](PV_model/pv_inverter.slx): we build a system [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9FhgHS1JsE) based on a DC voltage source. 
- [Model with PID controller](PV_model/pv_inverter_pid.slx): voltage control by PID controller.
- [PV model with PID controller](PV_model/pv_inverter_pv.slx): voltage control by PID controller and replacing the DC source using PV array.
